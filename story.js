  "It all started when I was just laying on my bed, I was so bored. My friends were all busy, some doing school activities while others were playing.",
  "I was really bored and thought I could talk to a new person or a new friend. I always thought having new friends was a good idea.",
  
  "I then asked my friend named Ahron if he had some friends that I could talk to. I also told him I wanted to talk to a girl haha.",
  "He told me about this girl named Ciara. Of course, I started searching for her social, then finally found it. I started talking to her and wow, she's so kind, sweet and friendly.",
  
  "We started talking, asking each other's hobbies, getting to know each other already. While talking, I think I already felt comfortable around her. She's just so fun to talk to.",
  "After a few more weeks, we got to know each other very well. We knew each other's birthdays, favorite food, and favorite color. We kept talking like there was no tomorrow.",
  
  "After a few months, I realized I had feelings for Ciara. I confessed. She told me she liked me as well, so I courted her.",
  "My friends thought Ciara and I should meet up. I thought it was a bad idea — we only talked for a few months and now we'd meet?",
  
  "I was scared because I know myself — I think I'm ugly. I told her I didn’t want to meet up, I was scared of judgment and that she’d leave me.",
  "She told me, \"Don't worry, I don't care about looks, all I want is your personality.\" She really reassured me and made me know I had nothing to be scared of.",
  
  "The night before we met, I was excited and scared at the same time. After school, my friends and I went to the meet-up place. It was very traffic.",
  "Ciara and Ahron were waiting for us at a convenience store. I arrived late because of traffic, then I saw her sitting on a bench. I just stood there, looking at her gorgeous, pretty, perfect face.",
  
  "When none of us made a move, Ahron pushed me in front of Ciara. I fell on the same bench where she was sitting.",
  "I was standing and about to sit, but Ciara hugged me first. I hugged her back. I was nervous since that was the first girl I ever hugged.",
  
  "We talked for minutes about how we were, how school was, and stuff. After a few minutes, she gave me her hairtie.",
  "She said, \"Take good care of it, so whenever you miss me, just hold on to that hairtie.\" I was so glad and hugged her.",
  
  "We went inside the convenience store. I was shy so I just talked to Ahron while inside. Ahron asked, \"Why aren't you talking to her, bro?\"",
  "I didn’t want to answer because Ciara was literally behind me. While laughing it off, Ciara hugged me from behind. I felt butterflies and was really blushing.",
  
  "After buying some snacks, we went outside and looked for a spot to hang out. While crossing the road, Ciara held my hand.",
  "I definitely fell even harder for her. It was my first time holding a woman's hand. Her hands were soft; I didn’t want to let go.",
  
  "We finally arrived and ate all the snacks. After a few minutes, Ahron had to go, leaving me and Ciara alone.",
  "We said goodbye to Ahron, waving while he walked away.",
  
  "Ciara and I talked about some random stuff. We sat eating and talking for hours till sunset. We watched the sunset, holding hands and leaning onto each other.",
  "It was the best day in my entire life. After a while, Ciara had to go home before dark.",
  
  "I led her to the bus station, hugged her, and she got on the bus. I waved goodbye as the bus left. I went home since it was getting dark.",
  "While riding the bus, I couldn’t help but smile and think about everything that happened that day.",
  
  "When I got home, I texted her asking if she got home safe. She responded quickly, saying \"Yes.\" We talked for a few minutes and then went to sleep.",
  "I had a really good sleep that night, even dreamed about what happened that day. I woke up happy and wished it would happen again.",
  
  "I wanted to meet her again, but she had strict parents. She said she couldn’t meet me again but maybe in a few weeks.",
  "It didn’t matter much; I was happy I met her and could still talk to her, even if just through texting.",
  
  "After a few months, we had a healthy relationship. Even though we had small problems, we kept finding ways to solve them.",
  "One day, she told me that her \"old crush\" texted her asking if she wanted to meet up. She told me the story about him.",
  
  "That guy was her grade 3 classmate, and they liked each other. But her mom found out, so Ciara transferred to another school. They never talked since then.",
  "I told Ciara it was fine to meet him. I didn’t mind, although I felt jealous, but I played games to forget it.",
  
  "A few days later, she became more distant and cold towards me. I felt like the \"spark\" was vanishing.",
  "After weeks, she told me she got back with that guy. I was devastated. I cried all night thinking where I went wrong.",
  
  "A few days later, Ciara blocked me on all socials. I wanted to end myself.",
  
  "Then, I saw she unblocked me. I said, \"I still love you,\" thinking she wouldn’t respond. But she did.",
  "We talked for a few minutes. I asked if I could meet her one last time, knowing she wouldn’t agree. But she did?",
  
  "The day we met came. I saw her from afar and walked towards her. I wanted to hug her but was shy because Ahron was there.",
  "He asked if I wanted to say something, but I was speechless.",
  
  "When he left, Ciara told me she couldn’t stay long. When she was about to leave, I hugged her tight. I didn’t want to let go.",
  "She hugged me too, saying it’s okay.",
  
  "A lot of people saw us hugging in public, saying we were cute. I was about to cry.",
  "When she left, I was sobbing but couldn’t do anything. I regret not saying anything while I was there with her.",
  
  "After that day, we didn’t talk anymore. Maybe she’s the right person but the wrong time.",
  "Or maybe we weren’t meant to be at all.",
  
  "First love has to be the worst."
